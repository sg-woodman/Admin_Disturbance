# Description: Combine extracted disturbances within admin zones

## Calculating the area/proportion of each land administration zone that is 
## disturbed each year is slow and requires parallelizing on the Plant Science
## Cluster. Here, the separate runs of the intersection and area calculation 
## are combined to create a single df where the mean proportion of admin zones
## disturbed across 2001-2019 is calculated.
